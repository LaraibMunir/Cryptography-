It is a type of Asymmetric Key Cryptography 
In asymmetric key cryptography, different keys are used for encryption and decryption – typically a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)
RSA encryption involves generating two large prime numbers, multiplying them, and using this product along with an exponent to generate public and private


Key Generation:
Generate two large prime numbers:  𝑝 and 𝑞
Compute totient function: 𝜙(𝑛)=(𝑝−1)×(𝑞−1)
Choose an encryption exponent 𝑒: e should be coprime with 𝜙(𝑛) and typically chosen as 65537 for efficiency.
Compute the decryption exponent 𝑑: d is multiplicative inverse of e
