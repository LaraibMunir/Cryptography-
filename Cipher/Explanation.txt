It is an example of Symmetric Key Cryptography
In symmetric key cryptography, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.

Caesar Cipher
simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.
It's a very simple form of encryption named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to communicate securely.

#Example
Plain text: Hello
Cypher text: Khoor

Encryption 
'H' -> ASCII: 72 -> 72 + 3 - 65 = 10 -> (10) % 26 = 10 -> 10 + 65 = 75 -> 'K'
Decryption
'K' -> ASCII: 75 -> 75 - 3 - 65 = 7 -> (7) % 26 = 7 -> 7 + 65 = 72 -> 'H'


eg H : shift 3: H,I,J,K
65: ASCII value of 'A'
97: ASCII value of 'a'
26: Total no. of alphabets in English 



The loop iterates through each character in the input text to apply the shift
result is an empty string to store the final encrypted text.
